# Goal and Preface!

Preface: 
Due to perfection and improvement of hardwares and associated techniques, accuracy and fidelity steadily improve over time. Through hardworks all scientists contributed(such as quantum error correction and qauntum fualt tolerant algorithms), we are seemed to be on the tail of NISQ era. To catch on and harness such tide as a group of students whose interpretaions and notions may not be as sharp and percise as experts in related realm. We would fistly follow chapter by chapter to learn through fundamental concepts and cement solid background about qauntum information and qauntum computaion in one of the most classic and recommanded textbook which is Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 10th Anniversary Edition (Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang) (Z-Library).

Goal:
Cultivate ability to read and understand related essays and papers to the extent that can explain those ideas from most superfacial to most impressive, in the prospect to be able to practically perform development or design of quantum algorithms that is actually problem-solving and of contribution to not only academia but society. 

[!NOTE]
Our current textbook is:Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 10th Anniversary Edition (Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang) (Z-Library)

# Solutions
Check the Complete solution [here]()/(yet finished)

There may include various formats for solution representation, such as `.pdf` or `.png` and `.tex` files. And if there are more than one solution to the same exercise, we would disscuss and merge those ideas into one best(biased of course) solution.

[!WARNING] 
These solutions should be used for students who want to further secure their understanding to the material. Because the solution is generated by  contributors mainly students, the solutions are not always correct(may sometimes error terribly in details). please be more careful and adpot dialectical views when referencing.

# Basic workflow for Git/Github and Github desktop.
   [!Tips]
The most important and basic regulation is **do not yelid pull request(PR) that directly change upstream main**. To biginner, I would list the basic workflow to use `git`/`github` and `git desktop`.
- **Fork** specific [repository](https://github.com/RebornantCBB/QCQI_reading), only for the first time one engaging in an open sourced project.
- **Open** and **Log in** `github desktop`, how to [install github desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) and [use github desk](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) 
- **clone** repository form your account to local working directory(this means in the https link `RebornantCBB` would be switch to `Your_github_username`)
- **create new branch** this is a extremely significant move, please be aware.
- **make changes** in your local working directory
- **commit** changes, which should contain both abstract and detail descriptions to your work.
- **Yeild PR** which is a request about to make change to the upstream repository, one should write PR with coherent and clean description about their content of work. 
- (Suggested but Optional)At the moment that your PR finally apporved, **Delete** your branch(to make your working directory clean and more easily for one to track whether their local main,remote main and upstream is sychornized to each other). 
- When one want to start a new work(like volunteer to offer more solutions to differnt exerises/problems here), **Redo** all the above-mentioned steps except for **Fork**.

Note:
1. For any one who need further, first-principle-viewed material to get fully understanding about fundamental git/github workflow, a start point may be [git full course](https://youtu.be/zTjRZNkhiEU?si=D-whFenNk92ar9wL) credit to [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)
2. Once any problems happended. Trouble-shoot them with reliable LLM such as ChatGPT, Cluade and Gimini or consult frequently with google. If problems are still suspended, try to ask groupmembers in this reading's group like so far our wechat politely. 



# Guidelines for contribution
1. Add your name agaist [list of contributiors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YBXTFXO4Gu4zAKTO1oMfD4B1ZHaGMmnpUIP1HehfEqA/edit?gid=0#gid=0) when you want to give solutions to specific exercise/problem.
2. `.pdf` or `.png` scheme:`image_yourname_Chapter_Section_Number_label` and upload such pictures to `image` folder in each corresponding chapters.
3. `.tex` file name scheme:  `Exercise_yourname_Chapter_Section_Number` or `Problem_yourname_Chapter_Section_Number` when it is a solution to a open problem. In the aim to eliminate format mess.
4. Please do PR(pull request) instead of commit directly into the `main` everytime one try to offer solutions to exercises. Which means one have to fork, clone and generate local working branch before pushing to main.  
5. If you find any error be sure to raise the issue. We would try to solve it ASAP.
6.Be polite and respectful to others =]

*For more details about PR look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request-from-github-desktop)*

**Anyone can join this reading, but must obey above-mentioned rules**

# Guidelines for Latex
1. Use `our template` as a startpoint to create solutions.
2. Main package we use
   - `amsmath` for equation alignment
   - `braket` to write dirac notation efficiently. More infos see [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/braket?lang=en)
   - `tikz` or `quantikz` to draw specific ciruit as you wish. More infos see [here](https://ctan.org/pkg/quantikz?lang=en)
3. If you are using other packages or template which may lead to output pdf far difference than our template, please contact the administrators such as *RebornantCBB*.
